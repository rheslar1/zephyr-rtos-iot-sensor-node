# Zephyr RTOS IoT Sensor Node Requirements

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-001 | The system shall expose a deterministic host-buildable runtime for Zephyr RTOS IoT Sensor Node. | CMake/CTest smoke run. |
| FR-002 | The system shall model the project focus: Edge sensor node with Zephyr threads, Wi-Fi/BLE provisioning, power-mode profiling, encrypted telemetry, and signed OTA firmware updates. | Scenario tests and documentation review. |
| FR-003 | The system shall separate runtime orchestration from hardware, OS, transport, model, or filesystem adapters. | Code structure review. |
| FR-004 | The system shall emit stable issue codes for rejected or degraded paths. | Failure-mode tests. |
| FR-005 | The system shall provide telemetry, report, persistence, or command output suitable for reviewer inspection. | CLI and artifact inspection. |
| FR-006 | The system shall document the path from host model to target hardware validation. | Design docs and roadmap. |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-001 | Implementation language shall be C++17 unless a target-specific file requires C, DTS, shell, or build metadata. | CMake toolchain gate. |
| NFR-002 | Runtime modules shall follow SOLID boundaries and favor constructor injection. | Design/code review. |
| NFR-003 | Tests shall run without attached hardware. | CI runner. |
| NFR-004 | Runtime output shall be deterministic for scripted scenarios. | Golden scenario checks. |
| NFR-005 | Documentation shall include system design, interfaces, validation, and roadmap. | Docs review. |

## Safety, Security, And Reliability Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSR-001 | Unsafe or incomplete input shall be rejected before side effects. | Prevent misleading output or unsafe control. |
| SSR-002 | Runtime health checks shall be visible in diagnostics. | Support field triage and production test. |
| SSR-003 | Update, credential, identity, or model metadata shall be versioned when present. | Avoid stale deployment assumptions. |
| SSR-004 | Failure paths shall preserve actionable evidence. | Make defects reproducible. |
| SSR-005 | Hardware-backed paths shall retain simulator-backed tests. | Keep CI useful without a bench setup. |

## Traceability

| Design Area | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime orchestration | FR-001, FR-002, NFR-004 |
| Adapter boundaries | FR-003, NFR-002, SSR-005 |
| Safety policy | FR-004, SSR-001, SSR-002 |
| Evidence output | FR-005, SSR-004 |
| Documentation and roadmap | FR-006, NFR-005 |
