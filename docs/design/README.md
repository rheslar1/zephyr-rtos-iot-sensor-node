# Zephyr RTOS IoT Sensor Node Design Package

## Purpose

Edge sensor node with Zephyr threads, Wi-Fi/BLE provisioning, power-mode profiling, encrypted telemetry, and signed OTA firmware updates.

This design package turns the project concept into an implementation-ready engineering plan. It defines system boundaries, runtime responsibilities, interface contracts, validation evidence, and the staged path from host simulation to target hardware.

## Design Principles

- Use C++17 value types for deterministic data contracts.
- Keep target-specific APIs behind narrow adapter interfaces.
- Apply SOLID boundaries so runtime orchestration does not depend directly on hardware drivers, transport libraries, or persistence details.
- Keep host-buildable tests aligned with target behavior through scripted adapters.
- Treat diagnostics, failure modes, and validation evidence as first-class deliverables.
